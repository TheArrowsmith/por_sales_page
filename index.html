				<h2>Phoenix is the new Rails</h2>

        <p>Elixir and Phoenix were both created by former Ruby developers. They take everything that's good about Ruby and Rails and improve upon them.</p>

        <p>Elixir is a functional language that runs on the Erlang VM. Erlang is well known for its ability to run low-latency, high-performance applications at a very high scale. Elixir wraps the power of Erlang in an elegant syntax that takes heavy inspiration from the beauty and simplicity of Ruby.</p>

        <p>Phoenix is a framework written in Elixir that's used to create high-scale, performant web apps in record speed. It takes all the good ideas that made Rails so successful and adds countless improvements for faster development time, higher maintainability and improved developer happiness.</p>

        <p>More and more Rails developers are making the switch to Elixir and Phoenix. If you like Rails, you're bound to love Phoenix development. The time's never been better to learn this new skill.</p>

        <h3>Who is this course for?</h3>

        <p>This course is aimed at developers who already have at least one year's experience programming in Ruby on Rails. If you don't know Ruby or Rails, you might still get some value from this course, but it's not guaranteed.</p>

        <p>This course uses the latest version of Phoenix as of August 2022. It will be kept up-to-date with future releases of Elixir and Phoenix. Purchase the course now and you'll receive all future updates for free.</p>

        <h3>Do I need to know Elixir?</h3>

        <p>This course assumes no existing knowledge of the Elixir language or the Phoenix framework. It explains all the Elixir concepts that you need to know in order to develop a Phoenix application.</p>

        <h3>What about the front-end?</h3>

        <p>Phoenix, like Rails, is a server-side technology. You can use it to build a fully-featured modern backend app that either communicates with the frontend via an API, or renders HTML views on the server side.</p>

        <p>This course explains how to build a fully-featured Phoenix backend that renders HTML views on the server side. The course covers the basics of managing a Phoenix app's frontend assets including Javascript and CSS files, but it doesn't explain how to a build a single-page application or a highly dynamic frotnend using modern Javascript frameworks like React or Vue.js. </p>

        <p>A future version of the course will explain how to build dynamic frontends using Phoenix LiveView; however, this has not yet been released.</p>
